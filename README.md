# Forecasting-Zakat-Collection-using-ARIMAX

## Zakat Collection Forecasting (2018â€“2024) using ARIMAX

This project focuses on forecasting RM collection amounts from 2018 to 2024 using the ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables) model.

### Project Highlights
Data: RM collection data from 2018 to 2024.

Exogenous Variables: Economic indicators such as Inflation, GDP Growth, and Unemployment Rate are included to improve forecast accuracy.

### Preprocessing:

- Checked and handled missing values.

- Performed stationarity tests (ADF test) and differencing to make the series stationary.

### Modeling:

- Built and tuned ARIMAX model using historical data.

- Evaluated performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

### Forecasting: Generated 6-year ahead predictions based on the historical trend and exogenous variables.

### Visualization: Plotted time series trends, ACF/PACF, and forecast results.

### Objective

- To create a reliable forecasting model that helps understand and predict future RM collection trends by incorporating both historical data and external economic factors.
